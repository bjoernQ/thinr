## About

Thinr is a replacement for AsyncTask. It is a tiny library that makes things like the following possible in a leak free and configuration change aware way:

```java
Thinr.task(getContext(), "getQOTD", MainActivity.class, Void.class)
                        .onMain((target, param) -> {
                            target.textView.setText(target.getApplicationContext().getString(R.string.loading_message));
                            return null;
                        })
                        .inBackground(
                                (appCtx, param, flowControl) -> {
                                    OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

                                    Request request = new Request.Builder()
                                            .url("http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random")
                                            .build();

                                    try {
                                        Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
                                        JSONObject json = new JSONObject(response.body().string());
                                        return json.getJSONObject("value").getString("joke");
                                    } catch (Exception e) {
                                        return null;
                                    }
                                }
                        )
                        .endsOnMain((target, qotd) -> {
                            if (qotd != null) {
                                target.textView.setText(qotd);
                            } else {
                                target.textView.setText(target.getApplicationContext().getString(R.string.error_message));
                            }
                        })
                        .execute(null, "ComponentID");
```

While the above example is not very exciting you might be able to estimate it's value considering it's

- life cycle aware
- leak free

Anything in "inBackground" will be executing on a background thread.

Anything in "onMain" will be executing when - and only when - the component is in a state that is fine for accessing the component.
Imagine that "inBackground" can be any time consuming blocking operation accessing the network and hitting the filesystem.

It's a beautiful replacement for AsyncTask (which it internally uses) when using Java 8.

You can also use it with Java 7 but Java 8 will make your experience much more exciting.

Currently the official support for Java 8 is limited to using Jack (see http://developer.android.com/preview/j8-jack.html ) but for sure the complete toolchain will support Java 8 sooner or later.

Additionally RetroLambda is supported starting with version 0.1.0.

If you still don't know what this will do for you have a look at other approaches making AsyncTask work (right) for you.

Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with AsyncTask - it just needs a lot of care to implement it in a leak and error free way.

Unfortunately those implementations add a lot of boiler plate code which made a lot of developers to come up with alternative solutions (which are also not easy to understand and do it right - and most of the time the code will look just ugly, hard to understand and hard to maintain).

If you ever did some non-trivial Android app you should know the pain I*m talking about.

## Objectives

The objectives of this tiny library are:

- easy usage
- easy to understand
- no boilerplate code involved (when using Java 8)
- easy to integrate
- no need to rewrite your whole code base to make use of it / can be introduced step-by-step where it is needed while leaving all the other code untouched
- non invasive (i.e. don't forces you to use a special style of programming)
- beautiful code (when using Java 8)

Additionally while the API is quite easy it comes with a lot of flexibility.

## Get started

The easiest way to get started is to look at the sample app. It's kept small to focus on the usage of Thinr.

## Integrate

This library is available on JCenter [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/bjoernq/maven/thinr/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/bjoernq/maven/thinr/_latestVersion)

Add the dependency to your app and make sure to use the jcenter repository:

```groovy
    compile 'de.mobilej:thinr:0.2.5'
```
